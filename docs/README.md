# Devacado
Devacado is a guidebook for people working in Developer Relations. We provide resources, articles, and information for those in the field, and those looking to get into it.

## About The Project
Devacado is a small project run by [Ryder Damen](https://twitter.com/ryderlikestacos). For me, transitioning from software engineering to developer relations seemed an arduous and difficult process. I'm building Devacado to make it easier for others.

It is still very much a work in progress, so if you have any recommendations, [please let me know!](https://twitter.com/ryderlikestacos).
